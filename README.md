# SDL2Stuff
My first usage of SDL2, will be absolute trash for a while.


Plans are to make some sort of game, but I'm still just learning C++, makefiles, and SDL2. RIP my to-do list


Windows:

Builds with Msys2 and probably Cygwin(untested)?
Builds fine with includes and lib files sourced from SDL2-2.0.14 MinGW Devel
For now builds statically so the file size is lorge. I don't know what to really do about that
Uses rm -rf in the makefile so will probably not build with default terminal. Will be fixed later

Mac:

Builds fine using clang and SDL2 installed through brew

Linux:

Untested as of yet
